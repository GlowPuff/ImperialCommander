<color="red">Hunted Down:</color>
When defeating a <color="red">Riot Trooper</color>, do not mark him as defeated in the app to keep it from being redeployed. Simply set aside the figure. After defeating the last figure, defeat the entire group.
The <color="red">Riot Troopers</color> can be redeployed. However, the terminal can be interacted with if the group has been defeated at least once.
