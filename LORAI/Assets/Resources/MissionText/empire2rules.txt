<color="red">Garrison:</color>
When defeating a <color="red">Riot Trooper</color>, do not mark him as defeated in the app to keep it from being redeployed. Simply set aside the figure. After defeating the last figure, defeat the entire group.
The <color="red">Riot Troopers</color> and the <color="red">Imperial Officer</color> can be redeployed. However, the diner counts as cleared if both groups have been defeated at least once.
